# Introduction to compound data types

## Quick intro
&#10149; Let us write a program doing maths with fractions:

::: {#lst-function-program lst-cap="A program for doing maths in fractions. Filename=`fraction_program.cpp`"}
```{ .cpp}
{{< include ./cpp/fraction_program.cpp >}}
```
:::
&#10149; Of course, we want to have a data type representing the concept of Fraction.

## Quick intro

&#10149; Now imagine that we are writing a program that needs to keep a list of employee IDs.
```{.cpp}
int main()
{
    int id1 { 42 };
    int id2 { 24 };
    int id3 { 162 };
    
    double salary1 { 42123.3 };
    double salary2 { 43784.5 };
    double salary3 { 39469.2 };

    // Names, roles, job titles and blah blah
}
```
&#10149; What if we had $100$ employes? Clearly, this naive approach simply does not scale.

## Quick intro: Compound data types

Fortunately, C++ supports **compound data types** (sometimes called **composite data types**).

- **Compound data types** are types that are defined in terms of other existing data types.
- **Compound data types** have additional properties & behaviros that make the useful for certain types of problems.


## Compound data types

C++ supports the following compound types.

::: {.fragment}
### Fundamental Compound Types (built-in)
- Functions (we already learned)
- C-style arrays
- Pointers
- References
:::

### User-defined Compound Types
- Structs (using keyword `struct`)
- Classes (using keyword `class`)
- Enumerations (using keyword `num` or `enum class`)
- Unions (using `union`)


::: {.fragment}
We shall learn most of them (not all of them due to time constraints).

- I aim at cover the following topics in the live lectures: C-style arrays, pointers, references, structs, classes, enumerations.
- You will see that structs and classes are very similar, and studying one carefully is enough.
